# TODOLIST

This is a simple react-application. Design based on bootstrap.  
You can create, delete and filter todos.
This is non-backend application, so all youre changes will be lost after page reload or restart.

## USAGE

`npm install` - install dependencies  
`npm start` - start application

## PLANS

I will not support this app, 'cause it's just a simple learning-project.  
All my ideas and new fetures i'll release at 'todo-redux' project.  
You`ll see it on my GitHub when it will be done.  
Thats all, guys!  
Good luck and clean code!
